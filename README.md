Do you have things to be computed? 
Do you wish they were computed?
Are you tired of having to deal with VMs to get those things computed. 

Well, here at Serverless-Buzzwordland we have just the solution. Just add your string based data to a queue and our 
helpful little watcher will automagicly spin up container based compute for each of your tasks.

But Serverless Buzzworldland, why do I care? 

Well Jimmy, let me tell you

1. This serverless based architecture takes seconds to start up.

2. It will only run while your task is being computed then shut down.

3. And best of all **YOU PAY PER SECOND**, thats like 60 times less than a minute!
